## Solution Architect | Java | Spring Cloud | AWS | Docker | Angular | *SQL, MongoDB | Selenium | Magnolia CMS | Elastic Search | Kafka

As Software Engineer I love lateral thinking to achieve business goals in projects and see the big picture in all projects  
In the last months, I have been designing and implementing:

* Content App is designed like a framework for easy integration of source with Low Code. Proof-of-Concept with integrating ElasticSearch and AWS S3 management items in Magnolia CMS.

* An API that simplifies End-to-End Testing with UI, helps ensure that the user interface meets the requirements of the project, from start to finish. This API provides an easy-to-use interface for setting up a testing environment, and writing and executing tests, with a Low Code solution.

* Develop a micro-services architecture to scale up services using Spring Boot Cloud, Kafka, Elastic Search, and Docker on AWS cloud.

* I'm developing a serverless crawler architecture on AWS Cloud and creating content for my tech blog.
